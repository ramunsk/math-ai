> A Node.JS CLI application that evaluates user input as mathematical expression and returns the result.

## Goals

-   write as less code as possible
-   use AI tools to:
    -   get knowledge about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions
    -   generate as much code as possible
    -   do not use Javascript's `eval()` function
